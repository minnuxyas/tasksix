I have taken an account in AWS by following the steps:

1.click on "Get started for Free" option in the link(https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signup?request_type=register)
2.sign up for AWS by providing email address and a desired account name. Then verify the email address. choose password and confirm it.
3.Enter your contact information, including your country/region, full name, address, city, state, postal code, and phone number.
4.Enter your credit card or debit card information. AWS requires this for billing purposes, even if you plan to use the free tier. Your card won't be charged unless you exceed the free tier limits or use paid services.
5.Verify your identity by receiving a text message or phone call with a verification code. Enter the code when prompted.
6.Choose one of the available support plans (Basic, Developer, Business, or Enterprise). The Basic plan is free and sufficient for most new users.
7.Review and complete the account setup process.
8.Once the account is created and verified, we can sign in to the AWS Management Console using  email address and password.
